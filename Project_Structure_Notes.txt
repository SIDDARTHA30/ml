Project Structure 

In our project we first install all required libraries using requirements.txt.
This file contains the list of Python libraries needed to run the project.
We run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install them.

After installing libraries, we run app.py, which is the main file of the project.
app.py is the heart of the project because it performs the full process like reading raw data, cleaning the data, training the model and showing the result.

In the project we have a data folder which contains two sub-folders.

The data/raw folder stores the original dataset collected from the source.
We never change this data.

The data/clean folder stores the cleaned and processed data after preprocessing.
This cleaned data is used for model training.

We also have a frontend, which is the user interface.
Frontend allows the user to enter input and see the prediction result.
It connects the user with the backend (app.py).
